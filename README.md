# 🥔 Potato Disease Classification Project

A deep learning project that classifies potato leaf diseases using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model can identify three classes: **Healthy**, **Early Blight**, and **Late Blight** from potato leaf images.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning solution for potato disease classification:

- **Training**: CNN model trained on the PlantVillage dataset
- **Web Application**: Interactive Streamlit app for real-time disease prediction
- **Model Performance**: Achieves high accuracy in classifying potato leaf diseases

## 🌟 Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Custom CNN architecture built with TensorFlow/Keras
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced training with image transformations
- **Web Interface**: User-friendly Streamlit application
- **Real-time Prediction**: Upload images and get instant disease classification
- **Confidence Scores**: Prediction confidence percentage for each classification

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaibhavRox/Potato-Disease-Classification-Project.git
   cd Potato-Disease-Classification-Project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   - The app will automatically open at `http://localhost:8501`
   - Upload a potato leaf image to get disease prediction

## 📊 Model Details

### Architecture
- **Model Type**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Input Size**: 256x256x3 (RGB images)
- **Classes**: 3 (Healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras

### Training Details
- **Dataset**: PlantVillage Potato Disease Dataset
- **Training Images**: 1,721 images
- **Validation Images**: 215 images
- **Data Augmentation**: Rotation, horizontal flip, rescaling
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

### Performance
The model achieves high accuracy on the test dataset with robust performance across all three disease categories.

## 🖼️ Dataset

The project uses the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of potato leaves in three categories:

1. **Potato___Early_blight**: Leaves affected by early blight disease
2. **Potato___Late_blight**: Leaves affected by late blight disease  
3. **Potato___healthy**: Healthy potato leaves

## 💻 Usage

### Web Application
1. Start the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Upload a potato leaf image (JPG, JPEG, or PNG)
3. View the prediction and confidence score
4. The app will classify the image as Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight

### Training Your Own Model
1. Navigate to the `Training/` directory
2. Open `training_image_data_gen.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to train a new model
4. The trained model will be saved as `potatoes.h5`

## 📋 Requirements

The project dependencies are minimal and include:

- `streamlit`: Web application framework
- `tensorflow`: Deep learning framework
- `Pillow`: Image processing library
- `numpy`: Numerical computing library

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Path
The application loads the model from `potatoes.h5`. If you train a new model or want to use a different model version, update the path in `app.py`:

```python
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("your_model_path.h5")
```

### Image Preprocessing
Images are automatically:
- Resized to 256x256 pixels
- Normalized to [0,1] range
- Converted to RGB format
